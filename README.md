### Hi there! 👋

My name is Ana Paula from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Back-End Developer since 2018 and currently I'm learning. I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a video game (:video_game:).

Would you like to find me?
